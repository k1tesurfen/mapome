# mapome
The lack of high resolution images of middle-earth got this project started. Mapome is based on the map provided by [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/lotr/comments/8oxyhb/high_resolution_map_of_middleearth/e07fkki?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) reddit post. I have not checked whether the map is entirely correct and I would not be surprised if there are some locations just vaguely placed based on brief mentions in the works of Tolkien. On this regard I am fully open for discussion.
